## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->

Description of the project in details.


We are tasked with creating five different designs of hero and card pages, using HTML and CSS. The purpose of the project is to develop and improve our web design skills and creativity. The key components include the layout and styling of hero sections, card elements, and the use of animations. The technology used is HTML and CSS, HTML is used to structure the content, while CSS is used to style the pages and create animations.

![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
